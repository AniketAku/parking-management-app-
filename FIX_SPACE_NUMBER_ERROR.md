# Fix: Database Trigger Error - space_number Field

## Problem

**Error**: `record "new" has no field "space_number"`

**Root Cause**: The `realtime_shift_statistics` trigger function was trying to access `NEW.space_number` but the `parking_entries` table doesn't have a `space_number` column.

**Impact**: Parking entry creation completely blocked - no vehicles could be registered.

## Solution Applied

### Fixed File
**Path**: `/database/functions/realtime_shift_statistics.sql`

**Change Made** (line 62 removed):
```sql
-- BEFORE (caused error)
json_build_object(
  'type', 'vehicle_entry',
  'shift_id', current_shift_id,
  'vehicle_number', NEW.vehicle_number,
  'entry_time', NEW.entry_time,
  'space_number', NEW.space_number,  ❌ This field doesn't exist
  'timestamp', NOW()
)

-- AFTER (fixed)
json_build_object(
  'type', 'vehicle_entry',
  'shift_id', current_shift_id,
  'vehicle_number', NEW.vehicle_number,
  'entry_time', NEW.entry_time,
  'timestamp', NOW()  ✅ Removed space_number reference
)
```

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
3. Create a new query

### Step 2: Deploy Fixed Trigger
1. Copy the entire contents of `/database/functions/realtime_shift_statistics.sql`
2. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
3. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter / Cmd+Enter)
4. Verify: You should see `Success. No rows returned`

### Step 3: Test Entry Creation
1. Refresh your parking web app (localhost:3000)
2. Navigate to **Vehicle Management → Entry**
3. Try to create a new parking entry
4. Verify: Entry should be created successfully without errors

## Technical Details

### Trigger Function
- **Name**: `update_shift_statistics_on_parking_change()`
- **Purpose**: Automatically updates shift statistics when parking entries change
- **Trigger**: Fires on INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on `parking_entries` table

### Error Context
The trigger was building a JSON notification object with:
```sql
PERFORM pg_notify('shift_statistics_updated', json_build_object(...))
```

The `json_build_object()` function tried to include `NEW.space_number` which doesn't exist in the table schema, causing PostgreSQL to throw the error.

### Why This Happened
The `space_number` field was likely part of an earlier design but was removed from the schema. The trigger function wasn't updated to match the schema change.

## Verification Checklist

After deployment:

- [ ] Trigger deployed successfully in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] No error messages in Supabase logs
- [ ] Web app refreshed (localhost:3000)
- [ ] New parking entry creation works
- [ ] Console logs show no `space_number` errors
- [ ] Entry appears in Vehicle Management → Current Vehicles

## Expected Console Logs

**After Fix** (successful entry):
```
✅ Vehicle entry created successfully!
```

**No More Errors** (these should be gone):
```
❌ DatabaseError: record "new" has no field "space_number"
❌ Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400
```

## Success Criteria

✅ **Fix Successful When**:
1. Trigger deploys without errors in Supabase
2. Parking entry form submission works
3. New entries appear in database
4. No console errors about `space_number`
5. Shift statistics update correctly

**Status**: ✅ CODE FIXED - Ready for deployment
**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Critical Fix**: Removed non-existent space_number field reference from trigger

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the fixed trigger** to Supabase (Step 2 above)
2. **Test entry creation** to verify fix works
3. **Monitor console logs** for any remaining issues

If you encounter any issues after deployment, check:
- Supabase SQL Editor for error messages
- Browser console for JavaScript errors
- Shift statistics are updating correctly
