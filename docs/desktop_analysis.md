### Technology Stack
- **GUI Framework**: CustomTkinter (modern tkinter wrapper)
- **Data Storage**: JSON file-based persistence
- **Architecture Pattern**: MVC with Observer pattern for data updates
- **Language**: Python 3.12+
- **Dependencies**: customtkinter, tkcalendar

## Current User Workflows

### 1. Dashboard/Home View Workflow
**File**: `ui/views/home.py`

**User Journey**:
1. Application launches showing dashboard overview
2. Real-time statistics displayed in cards:
   - Parked Vehicles (with truck icon 🚛)
   - Exited Vehicles (with checkmark ✅)
   - Total Income (with money icon 💰)
   - Unpaid Vehicles (with warning ⚠️)
3. Recent activity table shows last 10 entries with alternating row colors
4. Auto-refreshes when data changes via observer pattern
5. Navigation via left sidebar to other views

**Key Features**:
- Auto-refreshing dashboard with live statistics
- Recent activity feed with formatted timestamps
- Visual indicators for different data types
- Responsive grid layout

### 2. Vehicle Entry Workflow
**File**: `ui/views/entry.py`

**User Journey**:
1. Click "New Entry" from navigation
2. Fill required form fields:
   - Transport Name (required)
   - Vehicle Type (dropdown: Trailer, 6 Wheeler, 4 Wheeler, 2 Wheeler)
   - Vehicle Number (required, auto-uppercase)
   - Driver Name (optional, defaults to "N/A")
   - Notes (optional, defaults to "N/A")
3. System validates:
   - Required fields presence
   - Duplicate vehicle number check
   - Vehicle number normalization
4. Submit creates new parking entry with:
   - Auto-generated daily serial number
   - Current timestamp as entry time
   - Status: "Parked"
   - Fee: 0 (calculated at exit)
5. Success message and redirect to dashboard

**Edit Mode**:
- Can edit existing entries via search view
- Vehicle number becomes read-only
- All other fields editable
- Maintains entry time and original data integrity

### 3. Vehicle Exit Workflow
**File**: `ui/views/exit.py`

**User Journey**:
1. Click "Exit Vehicle" from navigation
2. Enter vehicle number in search field
3. System searches for "Parked" status vehicles with matching number
4. If found, displays detailed exit form:
   - Vehicle details (read-only)
   - Entry time with formatted display
   - Calculated days elapsed (any time > 0 = 1 day)
   - Daily rate based on vehicle type
   - Auto-calculated total fee
5. Override options:
   - Manual fee override (validates positive integer)
   - Payment status (Paid/Unpaid)
   - Payment type (Cash/Online)
6. Confirm exit processes:
   - Status change: "Parked" → "Exited" (irreversible)
   - Exit timestamp recorded
   - Fee finalized
   - Payment details saved
7. Success confirmation and return to dashboard

**Business Logic**:
- Fee calculation: (days elapsed) × (vehicle type rate)
- Minimum charge: 1 day even for minutes
- Manual override validation
- Status transition enforcement

### 4. Search and Reports Workflow
**File**: `ui/views/search.py`

**User Journey**:
1. Click "Search" from navigation
2. Multiple filter options available:
   - Vehicle number (partial match, case-insensitive)
   - Transport name (partial match, case-insensitive)
   - Status (All/Parked/Exited)
   - Vehicle type (All + vehicle types)
   - Payment status (All + payment statuses)
   - From date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
3. Search/Reset/Show All buttons for filter control
4. Results displayed in comprehensive table:
   - All entry details
   - Calculated duration display
   - Formatted timestamps
   - Currency-formatted fees
5. Table actions:
   - Double-click to edit entry
   - Select multiple entries for bulk delete
   - Export results to CSV with timestamp filename
   - Generate comprehensive text report

**Advanced Features**:
- Multi-criteria filtering with AND logic
- Real-time duration calculation
- CSV export with complete data
- Statistical report generation
- Bulk operations support

## Current Data Model

### Core Entity: ParkingEntry
**File**: `models/entry.py`

```python
{
    "serial": int,                    # Daily serial number
    "transport_name": str,            # Transport company name (required)
    "vehicle_type": str,              # One of VEHICLE_TYPES
    "vehicle_number": str,            # Uppercase normalized (required)
    "driver_name": str,               # Defaults to "N/A"
    "driver_phone": str,              # New field, defaults to "N/A"
    "notes": str,                     # Defaults to "N/A"
    "entry_time": str,                # ISO datetime string
    "status": str,                    # "Parked" | "Exited"
    "parking_fee": float,             # Final calculated/override fee
    "payment_status": str,            # "Paid" | "Unpaid" | "Pending" | "Refunded"
    "payment_type": str,              # "Cash" | "Credit Card" | "Debit Card" | "UPI"
    "exit_time": str,                 # ISO datetime or "N/A"
    "created_by": str,                # Defaults to "System"
    "last_modified": str              # ISO datetime, auto-updated
}
```

### Business Configuration
**File**: `config.py`

```python
# Vehicle types and daily rates
VEHICLE_TYPES = ["Trailer", "6 Wheeler", "4 Wheeler", "2 Wheeler"]
RATES = {
    "Trailer": 225,
    "6 Wheeler": 150,
    "4 Wheeler": 100,
    "2 Wheeler": 50
}

# Payment options
PAYMENT_TYPES = ["Cash", "Credit Card", "Debit Card", "UPI"]
PAYMENT_STATUS_OPTIONS = ["Paid", "Unpaid", "Pending", "Refunded"]

# Business rules
MAX_PARKING_SPOTS = 100
OVERSTAY_HOURS = 24
OVERSTAY_PENALTY_RATE = 50.0
```

## Current Business Logic (CRITICAL TO PRESERVE)

### Fee Calculation Algorithm
**Location**: `models/entry.py:calculate_fee()`

```python
def calculate_fee(self):
    entry_dt = datetime.fromisoformat(self.entry_time)
    exit_dt = datetime.now() if self.exit_time == "N/A" else datetime.fromisoformat(self.exit_time)
    days = (exit_dt - entry_dt).days + (1 if (exit_dt - entry_dt).seconds > 0 else 0)
    return days * RATES.get(self.vehicle_type, 100)
```

**CRITICAL RULES** (must be preserved exactly):
- Any parking duration > 0 seconds = 1 full day charge
- Days calculation: `days + (1 if seconds > 0 else 0)`
- Rate lookup with 100 as default fallback
- Manual override allows different final fee

### Data Validation Rules

1. **Vehicle Number Normalization**: Always uppercase
2. **Required Fields**: transport_name, vehicle_number
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Cannot park same vehicle twice
4. **Status Transitions**: Parked → Exited (one-way only)
5. **Fee Validation**: Must be positive integer
6. **Default Values**: "N/A" for optional empty fields

### Overstay Detection
```python
def is_overstayed(self, max_hours=24):
    return self.get_duration_hours() > max_hours and self.status == "Parked"
```

### Data Integrity Features

1. **Automatic Backups**: Before every data modification
2. **Audit Trail**: last_modified timestamp on updates
3. **Unique Identification**: vehicle_number + entry_time composite key
4. **Observer Pattern**: Real-time UI updates on data changes

## Current Data Storage Pattern

### File Structure
- **Primary**: `parking_data.json` - Main data file
- **Backups**: `backups/` directory with timestamped files
- **Exports**: CSV and text reports with timestamps

### Data Operations
**File**: `services/data_service.py`

1. **Load**: JSON deserialization with error handling
2. **Save**: Automatic backup + JSON serialization
3. **Add**: Append new entries with validation
4. **Update**: Find by composite key + replace
5. **Delete**: Filter out specified entries
6. **Statistics**: Comprehensive calculation from live data

## Current UI Components and Interactions

### Navigation Pattern
- Left sidebar navigation with view switching
- Main content area with header and body
- Consistent color scheme and CustomTkinter styling

### Data Update Pattern
```python
# Observer pattern implementation
def register_data_updated_callback(self, callback):
    self.data_updated_callbacks.append(callback)

def notify_data_updated(self):
    for callback in self.data_updated_callbacks:
        callback()
```

### Form Interactions
- Consistent form field creation patterns
- Validation with error messages
- Success confirmations
- Auto-clearing after submission

### Table Interactions
- CustomTkinter frames with ttk.Treeview
- Alternating row colors
- Scrollbars for large datasets
- Double-click editing
- Multi-select for bulk operations

## Performance Characteristics
