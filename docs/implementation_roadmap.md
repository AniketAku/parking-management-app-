## Phase-by-Phase Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation & Local Database Migration

2. Maintain identical data access patterns
3. Preserve all business logic and calculations
4. Create comprehensive backup and rollback systems
5. Validate complete data migration integrity

### Phase 1.1: Environment Preparation (Day 1)
```bash
# Development environment setup
git checkout -b feature/database-migration
python -m venv venv_migration
pip install -r requirements_migration.txt

# Backup creation
python migration/create_comprehensive_backup.py
```

**Deliverables**:
- Development environment isolated from production
- Complete system backup (application + data + configuration)
- Migration validation scripts prepared
- Rollback procedures tested

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] All dependencies installed and validated
- [ ] Backup integrity verified with restore test
- [ ] Rollback scripts execute successfully in <2 minutes
- [ ] Development environment isolated from production data

### Phase 1.2: Database Schema Creation (Day 2)
```python
# Execute database initialization
from migration.data_migration_plan import MigrationExecutor

config = MigrationConfig(
    source_json_path="parking_data.json",
    target_db_path="data/parking_local.db",
    validation_enabled=True
)

# Initialize database schema
executor = MigrationExecutor(config)
executor.db_manager.initialize_database()
executor.db_manager.validate_database_schema()
```

**Deliverables**:
- SQLite database with complete schema
- Indexes for optimal performance
- Constraints for data integrity
- Configuration tables populated

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Database schema matches specification exactly
- [ ] All indexes created and optimized
- [ ] Constraints properly enforced
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets

### Phase 1.3: Data Migration Execution (Day 3)
```python

if migration_success:
    print("✅ Migration completed successfully")
    # Proceed with validation
else:
    print("❌ Migration failed - executing rollback")
    executor._execute_rollback()
```

**Migration Process**:
1. **Pre-migration Validation**: JSON structure and business rule compliance
2. **Batch Migration**: Process entries in batches of 100 with validation
3. **Transformation Validation**: Verify each entry transformation preserves business logic
4. **Post-migration Verification**: Complete data integrity and statistics validation
5. **Performance Validation**: Ensure database operations meet performance targets

**Critical Validation Points**:

- Business rule compliance (no duplicate active parking, valid statuses)
- Fee calculation verification (spot-check 10% of entries)
- Statistical totals match (revenue, counts by status, etc.)
- Performance benchmarks (load time <2s, search <500ms)

**Validation Criteria**:
