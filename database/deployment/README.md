# Parking Management System - Database Deployment Guide

Complete deployment package for Supabase with reconciled schema and comprehensive security.

## üöÄ Quick Deployment

### Step 1: Prepare Supabase Project
1. Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Get your project URL and anon key from Settings > API
3. Copy the Supabase URL (format: `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`)

### Step 2: Deploy Database
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the entire contents of `deploy.sql`
3. Click "Run" to execute the deployment
4. Verify success message in the output

### Step 3: Update Application Environment
```bash
# Update your .env.local file
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-actual-anon-key
VITE_DISABLE_REALTIME=false
```

### Step 4: Test Application
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Login with default credentials: `admin` / `admin123`
3. **IMMEDIATELY change the default password!**

## üîß Individual Components

If you need to run components separately:

### Schema Only
```sql
-- Run 01-unified-schema.sql in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Creates tables, indexes, triggers, and enables RLS
```

### Security Policies Only
```sql
-- Run 02-access-policies.sql after schema
-- Creates RLS policies and utility functions
```

### Seed Data Only
```sql
-- Run 03-seed-data.sql after schema and policies
-- Creates admin user and essential configuration
```

## üîí Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Admin**: Full access to all data
- **Operator**: Can create/update parking entries, read configs
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to parking data

### User Roles
- `admin`: System administrator with full privileges
- `operator`: Parking operations staff
- `viewer`: Read-only access for reporting

### Data Protection
- All tables protected by RLS policies
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Audit logging for all changes
- System settings protection

## üìä Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **users**: System users with role-based access
- **app_config**: Application configuration and settings
- **parking_entries**: Core parking business data
- **audit_log**: Change tracking and audit trail

### Key Features
- UUID primary keys for security
- Automatic timestamps on all records
- Data validation with CHECK constraints
- Comprehensive indexing for performance

## üîë Default Login

**Username**: `admin`
**Password**: `admin123`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Change this password immediately after deployment!

## üìã Post-Deployment Checklist

### Security Tasks
- [ ] Change default admin password
- [ ] Create additional user accounts as needed
- [ ] Test user role permissions
- [ ] Verify RLS policies are working
- [ ] Enable audit logging in application

### Application Configuration
- [ ] Update environment variables
- [ ] Test database connectivity
- [ ] Verify real-time features work
- [ ] Run application test suite
- [ ] Validate data entry workflows

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Configure backup procedures
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts
- [ ] Review performance indexes
- [ ] Document user management procedures
- [ ] Plan regular security audits

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"relation does not exist" errors**
- Ensure you ran the complete `deploy.sql` script
- Check that all tables were created successfully

**RLS policy errors**
- Verify user has proper role assigned
- Check user is approved (`is_approved = true`)
- Ensure user is active (`is_active = true`)

**Authentication failures**
- Verify Supabase URL and keys are correct
- Check that default admin user was created
- Ensure password hash is correct

**Real-time connection issues**
- Verify Supabase project URL is accessible
- Check that `VITE_DISABLE_REALTIME=false`
- Test WebSocket connectivity

### Support Commands

```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Verify RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Check user accounts
SELECT username, role, is_active, is_approved FROM users;

-- View configuration
SELECT category, key, value FROM app_config ORDER BY category, sort_order;

-- Check policies
SELECT tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

## üîÑ Schema Reconciliation

This deployment resolves inconsistencies between the original database schema and TypeScript types:

### Fixed Issues
- Added `driver_phone` field to parking_entries
- Reconciled status values (`Active`, `Exited`, `Overstay`)
- Unified payment status values (`Paid`, `Pending`, `Partial`, `Failed`)
- Added missing fields for TypeScript compatibility

### Required TypeScript Updates
See `TYPESCRIPT-UPDATES.md` for detailed changes needed in your TypeScript code.

## üìû Support

For deployment issues or questions:
1. Check this README for common solutions
2. Review Supabase logs in your project dashboard
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Test with provided default credentials first

## üöÄ Performance Tips

- Indexes are optimized for common query patterns
- Use connection pooling for production
- Monitor query performance in Supabase dashboard
- Consider read replicas for high-traffic applications
